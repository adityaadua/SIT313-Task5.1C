# SIT313-Task5.1C

AS YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A SRC FOLDER APART FROM UPLOADED FILES, they might look the same but they aren't (to some extent). 
The updated src folder contains the updated website as requested by the tutor while demonstrating my project.
the changes are displayed in the src folder whether it may be in the css or in the jsx files.
